## Descripción:
I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!You download the challenge files here:

- [challenge.zip](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/136/challenge.zip)

Hints:
- Version control can help you recover files if you change or lose them!
- Read the chapter on Git from the picoPrimer [here](https://primer.picoctf.org/#_git_version_control)
- You can 'checkout' commits to see the files inside them
